  Tests that MCP tools can be configured with a tool_name_prefix.
  This feature allows prefixing all tools from an MCP server to avoid naming conflicts
  when multiple MCP toolsets are used.

  This test verifies:
  - Tools are registered with the prefix (e.g., "memory_get_data_http" instead of "get_data_http")
  - The prefixed tool can be called by the LLM
  - Tool responses are processed correctly with the prefixed name
  - The prefix prevents naming conflicts when the same server is connected multiple times
