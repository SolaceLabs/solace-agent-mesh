# Solace Agent Mesh (SAM) Feature Overview

## Introduction

The Solace Agent Mesh (SAM) provides a robust, enterprise-grade framework for building and deploying sophisticated AI agents. At its heart, SAM leverages the power and flexibility of Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) for core agent logic, including LLM interaction, tool use, and conversation history management.

SAM enhances the ADK by integrating it into a scalable, event-driven architecture. It adopts the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for standardized message schemas and interaction patterns, ensuring interoperability between different components. However, instead of relying on direct HTTP calls, SAM uses an event broker for all communication. This provides a truly asynchronous, decoupled platform where agents and services can interact reliably and efficiently, even across different environments and at massive scale.

This document outlines the key features that SAM provides on top of the standard ADK library, enabling developers to build powerful, collaborative, and production-ready AI solutions.

## Feature Highlights

*   **Event-Driven A2A Protocol:** A complete, asynchronous communication protocol for all system components, built on an event broker for scalability and resilience.
*   **Dynamic Agent-to-Agent Delegation:** Agents can discover and delegate tasks to other specialized agents on the mesh as easily as calling a local tool.
*   **Advanced Artifact Management:** Go beyond basic storage with automatically generated metadata, schema inference for structured data, and support for production-grade storage backends like S3.
*   **Dynamic Content Generation ("Embeds"):** A powerful mini-language within prompts that allows for dynamic data transformation, content embedding, and on-the-fly calculations.
*   **Intelligent Content Processing:** Automatically parse and structure complex tool outputs (e.g., from MCP tools) into multiple, well-defined artifacts.
*   **Robust Configuration & Initialization:** A declarative configuration framework with built-in validation and a flexible tool-loading system simplifies agent setup and deployment.
*   **Pluggable Enterprise Services:** Easily integrate with your existing enterprise systems through swappable providers for services like identity and employee directories.
*   **Extensible Middleware:** A pluggable middleware layer allows for custom logic to handle user-specific configurations and feature access control.
*   **Comprehensive Tool Library:** A rich set of built-in tools for data analysis, file conversion, image generation, and more, ready to be enabled in any agent.
*   **Enhanced Observability:** Advanced debugging tools, including detailed invocation logging and Datadog-compatible output, provide deep visibility into agent behavior.

## Core Architecture & Communication Layer

While the ADK provides the "brain" for an individual agent, the Solace Agent Mesh provides the "nervous system" that allows a fleet of agents to communicate and operate as a cohesive, enterprise-grade system. This is achieved through a foundational architecture built on three key pillars.

First, SAM replaces direct agent-to-agent HTTP calls with a powerful **event-driven architecture**. All communication—requests, responses, and status updates—is exchanged as messages over an event broker. This decouples every component, meaning agents don't need to know each other's network location or status. The result is a highly scalable and resilient mesh that can handle agents joining, leaving, or failing without disrupting the entire system.

Second, all communication adheres to the **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol**, which provides a standardized and structured format for every interaction. This common language ensures that messages, tasks, and file attachments are handled consistently and reliably, eliminating ambiguity between different agents and services. It creates a predictable and interoperable ecosystem where any new component that "speaks A2A" can immediately participate.

Finally, SAM introduces a **managed agent lifecycle and a formal Task Execution Context**. Each agent operates as an independent, self-contained component, ensuring that one agent's workload doesn't block or slow down others. For each request an agent receives, the framework creates a dedicated "control center" that manages the task's state from start to finish. This provides robust, fine-grained control over long-running operations, cancellation signals, and streaming data—capabilities essential for complex, real-world workflows that go far beyond a single LLM turn.

## Inter-Agent Communication (A2A Delegation)

SAM transforms individual agents into a collaborative team of specialists. Instead of being limited to its own local tools, a SAM agent can dynamically discover other agents on the mesh and delegate tasks to them as if they were simple function calls. This powerful abstraction allows agents to specialize in specific domains—like data analysis, customer communication, or system monitoring—and seamlessly collaborate to solve complex problems.

Crucially, this delegation is fully asynchronous and non-blocking. When an agent delegates a task, it doesn't wait idly for the response. It can continue working on other parts of a problem or even delegate tasks to multiple other agents in parallel. The SAM framework manages this complex orchestration behind the scenes, tracking all outstanding requests, handling timeouts, and gathering all the peer responses before re-engaging the original agent with the complete set of results.

This capability moves beyond the single-agent paradigm, enabling the creation of sophisticated, multi-agent systems that can tackle complex, multi-step problems by distributing work to the most qualified specialist available on the mesh.

## Enhanced Artifact Management

SAM elevates the ADK's basic file storage into a sophisticated, intelligent artifact management system. Where the standard ADK provides a simple way to save a file, SAM enriches this process, making artifacts more discoverable, understandable, and ready for enterprise use.

First, every artifact saved in SAM is automatically paired with a **rich metadata file**. This acts like a digital label, capturing not just the file's name and type, but also a description of its contents, its origin, and other custom details. This ensures that both users and other agents can understand an artifact's purpose and context without having to inspect its contents manually.

For structured data like CSV, JSON, or YAML files, SAM goes a step further by performing **automatic schema inference**. When an agent saves a data file, the framework intelligently analyzes its structure—such as column headers in a CSV or the key-value layout of a JSON object—and includes this schema in the metadata. This gives the LLM a "table of contents" for the data, enabling it to write accurate queries and transformations in subsequent steps without first needing to load and read the entire file.

Finally, SAM provides **pluggable, production-grade storage backends**. Instead of being limited to the ADK's default in-memory storage (where files are lost on restart), SAM supports persistent storage on a local filesystem or in enterprise cloud object stores like Amazon S3. This makes artifacts durable and reliable, turning them from temporary outputs into managed, long-term assets for your AI applications.
