# Solace Agent Mesh (SAM) Feature Overview

## Introduction

The Solace Agent Mesh (SAM) provides a robust, enterprise-grade framework for building and deploying sophisticated AI agents. At its heart, SAM leverages the power and flexibility of Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) for core agent logic, including LLM interaction, tool use, and conversation history management.

SAM enhances the ADK by integrating it into a scalable, event-driven architecture. It adopts the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for standardized message schemas and interaction patterns, ensuring interoperability between different components. However, instead of relying on direct HTTP calls, SAM uses an event broker for all communication. This provides a truly asynchronous, decoupled platform where agents and services can interact reliably and efficiently, even across different environments and at massive scale.

This document outlines the key features that SAM provides on top of the standard ADK library, enabling developers to build powerful, collaborative, and production-ready AI solutions.

## Feature Highlights

*   **Event-Driven A2A Protocol:** A complete, asynchronous communication protocol for all system components, built on an event broker for scalability and resilience.
*   **Dynamic Agent-to-Agent Delegation:** Agents can discover and delegate tasks to other specialized agents on the mesh as easily as calling a local tool.
*   **Advanced Artifact Management:** Go beyond basic storage with automatically generated metadata, schema inference for structured data, and support for production-grade storage backends like S3.
*   **Dynamic Content Generation ("Embeds"):** A powerful mini-language within prompts that allows for dynamic data transformation, content embedding, and on-the-fly calculations.
*   **Intelligent Content Processing:** Automatically parse and structure complex tool outputs (e.g., from MCP tools) into multiple, well-defined artifacts.
*   **Robust Configuration & Initialization:** A declarative configuration framework with built-in validation and a flexible tool-loading system simplifies agent setup and deployment.
*   **Pluggable Enterprise Services:** Easily integrate with your existing enterprise systems through swappable providers for services like identity and employee directories.
*   **Extensible Middleware:** A pluggable middleware layer allows for custom logic to handle user-specific configurations and feature access control.
*   **Comprehensive Tool Library:** A rich set of built-in tools for data analysis, file conversion, image generation, and more, ready to be enabled in any agent.
*   **Enhanced Observability:** Advanced debugging tools, including detailed invocation logging and Datadog-compatible output, provide deep visibility into agent behavior.
