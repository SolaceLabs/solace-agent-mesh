# DEVELOPER GUIDE: components

## Quick Summary
This directory contains components for the HTTP SSE (Server-Sent Events) gateway, designed to work within the Solace AI Connector (SAC) framework. The primary component forwards messages received from the Solace broker to an internal queue, enabling real-time visualization in a web-based user interface.

## Files Overview
- `__init__.py` - Makes the `VisualizationForwarderComponent` class directly importable from the `components` package
- `visualization_forwarder_component.py` - Defines a component that forwards messages from a broker input to a Python `queue.Queue` for visualization

## Developer API Reference

### __init__.py
**Purpose:** Exposes the public components of this directory for easy importing
**Import:** `from gateway.http_sse.components import VisualizationForwarderComponent`

**Exports:**
- `VisualizationForwarderComponent` - The main component class for forwarding messages to a visualization queue

### visualization_forwarder_component.py
**Purpose:** A Solace AI Connector (SAC) component that listens for messages from a `BrokerInput` and forwards them to a specified Python `queue.Queue` for real-time display in web UI
**Import:** `from gateway.http_sse.components.visualization_forwarder_component import VisualizationForwarderComponent`

**Classes:**
- `VisualizationForwarderComponent(**kwargs: Any)` - A component that forwards messages to a target queue, initialized with configuration parameters including `target_queue_ref`
  - `invoke(message: SolaceMessage, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None` - Core method called by SAC framework for each incoming message; formats data and places it onto target queue (framework-managed, not called directly)

**Constants/Variables:**
- `info: Dict` - Metadata dictionary required by SAC framework describing component's configuration parameters, input schema, and purpose

**Usage Examples:**
```python
import queue
from gateway.http_sse.components import VisualizationForwarderComponent
from solace_ai_connector.common.message import Message as SolaceMessage

# 1. Create a target queue that will receive the forwarded messages
# This queue is typically managed by another component, like a Web UI backend
visualization_queue = queue.Queue()

# 2. Instantiate the component with reference to the target queue
# This is usually done within a SAC flow configuration file
forwarder = VisualizationForwarderComponent(
    name="my_forwarder",
    target_queue_ref=visualization_queue
)

# 3. The invoke method is called automatically by the SAC framework
# when a message arrives from a connected BrokerInput component

# Example of consuming from the queue:
if not visualization_queue.empty():
    forwarded_data = visualization_queue.get()
    print(f"Received topic: {forwarded_data['topic']}")
    print(f"Received payload: {forwarded_data['payload']}")

# Expected structure of forwarded_data:
# {
#     "topic": "some/broker/topic",
#     "payload": {"key": "value"},
#     "user_properties": {"prop1": "value1"},
#     "_original_broker_message": <SolaceMessage object>
# }
```
