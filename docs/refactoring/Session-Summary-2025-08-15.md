# Session Summary: A2A SDK Migration (2025-08-15)

## 1. Session Goal

The primary goal of this session was to plan and begin the execution of a major refactoring initiative: migrating the Solace Agent Mesh from a legacy, custom A2A protocol implementation to the official `a2a-sdk`. The focus was on establishing a robust plan and then implementing the foundational backend changes in a controlled, test-driven manner.

## 2. Documents Created

We created a comprehensive set of planning and tracking documents to guide the refactoring effort:

*   **`docs/refactoring/A2A-SDK-Migration.md`**: The main strategic document outlining the goals, requirements, and high-level, multi-phase approach for the entire project.
*   **`docs/refactoring/Phase-0-Checklist.md`**: A detailed checklist for the preparatory "Tooling & Setup" phase.
*   **`docs/refactoring/A2A-Type-Migration-Map.md`**: A critical reference document mapping legacy data models to the new `a2a-sdk` types, including examples.
*   **`docs/refactoring/Phase-1-Design.md`**: The detailed design document for the backend refactoring phase.
*   **`docs/refactoring/Phase-1-Implementation-Plan.md`**: A step-by-step implementation plan for developers to follow during Phase 1.
*   **`docs/refactoring/Phase-1-Checklist.md`**: A detailed checklist for tracking the backend implementation tasks.

## 3. Implementation Progress

We successfully completed all of Phase 0 and a significant portion of Phase 1.

### Phase 0: Preparation & Tooling (Completed)

*   **Task 1: Integrated `a2a-sdk`:** The `a2a-sdk` was added as a project dependency and verified.
*   **Task 2: Automated Schema Sync:** The `scripts/sync_a2a_schema.py` script was created and implemented. It reliably fetches the correct `a2a.json` schema from GitHub based on the installed SDK version, including fallback logic for patch versions.
*   **Task 3: Refactored `A2AMessageValidator`:** The test validator was rewritten to use `jsonschema` and the synchronized `a2a.json` file, providing a robust mechanism for validating all A2A messages during tests.
*   **Task 4: Created Migration Map:** The `A2A-Type-Migration-Map.md` was created to guide developers.

### Phase 1: Backend Refactoring & Validation (In Progress)

*   **Section A: Data Models (Completed):**
    *   Created JSON schemas for all custom `DataPart` payloads.
    *   Created the corresponding Pydantic models in `src/solace_agent_mesh/common/data_parts.py`.
*   **Section B: Agent Request Handling (Completed):**
    *   Refactored `event_handlers.py` to parse incoming requests using the new `a2a.types` models, including server-side `taskId` generation and `contextId` handling.
*   **Section C: Status Update Generation (Completed):**
    *   Refactored all status update callbacks in `callbacks.py` to use the new structured `DataPart` models instead of custom `metadata` fields.
*   **Section D: Peer Agent Delegation (Completed):**
    *   Updated the `PeerAgentTool` to create compliant A2A requests.
    *   Refactored the `SamAgentComponent` and `event_handlers` to manage the new peer-to-peer communication flow and correlation logic.
*   **Section E: Test Infrastructure (In Progress):**
    *   Refactored the `BaseGatewayComponent` (and by extension, the `TestGatewayComponent`) to use `a2a.types` for submitting tasks and parsing responses.

## 4. Next Steps

The immediate next step is to continue with **Phase 1, Section E: Update Test Infrastructure**.

*   **Task 25:** Update assertions in the integration tests to validate the new `DataPart`-based status update structures.
*   **Task 26:** Update all mock A2A message fixtures in `conftest.py` to conform to the new `a2a.json` schema.

Once these tasks are complete, we will proceed to **Section F: Final Validation** to run the entire test suite and ensure the backend refactoring is stable and correct.
